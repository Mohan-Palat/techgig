This means that the human side of getting together gets lost, the side that lives off spontaneous chats, random encounters or unexpected conversations. We believe that's at the core of 'Zoom fatigue' - not poor video connection or audio issues.</p>\n<p>Wonder is a virtual space where you can connect to others in a more spontaneous and fluid way. You walk around freely and choose what groups you want to join. It's fun, creative, energizing and we believe it's the future of how people will get together online. You can check it out <a href=\"https://www.wonder.me/r?id=wonder-team-office\"><strong>here</strong></a></p>\n<p>We're a VC-backed team based in Kreuzberg, Berlin. If you want to learn more about us and what it's like to work at Wonder, have a look at this <a href=\"https://app.pitch.com/app/public/presentation/79be9368-d12b-41a1-b2a3-fb3e9f50c420\"><strong>presentation</strong></a> we created for you.</p>\n<p><strong>You will be part of our world-class product team</strong>\nThe mission of our product team is to define and execute the product vision. We ship major new features bi-weekly while making sure the product runs smoothly and without bugs. We're fast.</p>\n<p><strong>As part of that team, you will:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lead the technical development of the product.</li>\n<li>Own the ongoing refactoring process.</li>\n<li>Help developers grow and learn along technical and non-technical dimensions.</li>\n<li>Contribute your best knowledge and experience about technology, products, and processes.</li>\n<li>Shape the product roadmap with us.</li>\n<li>Write code (duh).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Who we look for</strong>\nBroadly speaking, we look for product people. Concretely, this means you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have experience in building an engaged and high-performance team.</li>\n<li>You are a strong communicator around hard concepts and have a pragmatic approach.</li>\n<li>Know the latest state of technology and what we can do with it.</li>\n<li>Have a strong instinct for great products and what makes them great.</li>\n<li>Love Wonder as much as we do.</li>\n<li>Experience in JavaScript and one or more programming languages (e.g. C/C++, Python, Go, Java).</li>\n<li>Experience across the full JS-based stack (both Node.JS and ReactJS).</li>\n<li>Ideally, you have experience with PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, WebRTC, Redis, CI/CD.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We strongly encourage female and diverse candidates to apply. The role is based in Berlin, with flexible working arrangements, a generous equity package, and competitive pay.</p>\n<p><strong>Why you should join us</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our work is technically challenging: we're using WebGL for rendering 3-dimensional rooms that expand when more users join. Now, we are starting to build our own WebRTC backend. It's incredibly challenging to enable real-time communication and data-flow between thousands of user.</li>\n<li>The future of work is a hot topic: remote communication will transform the way humans live and work. We want to become a core pillar of the online working stack. You'll tell your grandchildren that you were part of it.</li>\n<li>We have a world-class engineering team: we're a product-focused company and are assembling some of the smartest and most talented developers and designers to build Wonder.</li>\n<li>It's an exciting stage: You will shape a product from the very beginning and see its fastest growth. If you want to build something, this is just the right time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Interested?</strong>\nApply via the online <a href=\"https://ltpx.nl/jLQj7wM\"><strong>application form</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><em>Agency calls are not appreciated.</em><img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/043b19c9a2a9e79b91089ecb661e02dc67dbeeaa/68747470733a2f2f62636f6e74726f6c2e62726f636b6d657965722e6e6c2f747261636b2e7068703f6f7264657269643d323034333334\"></p>\n",

We've found that both candidates with traditional CS backgrounds as well as others who are self-taught or freelancers can excel at our company.</p>\n<p>We're not interested in hiring for any particular niche skill at the moment. Rather, we like to engage with engineers who have a well rounded and full stack background, either for web or mobile. If you feel particularly strong in one skill though, we still would like to talk.</p>\n<h2>More About The Role</h2>\n<p>As an engineer at our company, you'll work directly with our CTO and Creative Director and other engineers on a variety of software projects covering different programming languages, frameworks, and application architectures.</p>\n<p>The single best reason to be an engineer at our company is because of the exposure to different programming languages, technologies and client projects.</p>\n<p>Typical client work includes building any of the following: web and mobile apps, public and private API's, static sites and CMS platforms, e-commerce sites like Shopify stores, and digital transformation projects with enterprise clients.</p>\n<p>For more information about how we run our Sprints and manage our SDLC, read <a href=\"https://lightmatter.com/playbook/\">our company Playbook</a>.</p>\n<h2>Specific Qualifications</h2>\n<p>Ideally, you have experience with the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You have 2+ years working as a software engineer at another agency, a product focused startup, or an enterprise company.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have spent some time freelancing independently, whether as a side hustle or full time. Almost everyone on our team has been an individual freelancer at one point, and understands the value of all the “work” outside of the actual deliverable for the client: excellent communication, professionalism, punctuality and follow through.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You have 0 ego with regards to your code, can both receive and offer feedback positively, and are willing to pair and help others as develop software alongside you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You're a self-starter. You're not afraid to take initiative, but know when and how to check with others to ensure you're making the right decision. You can balance the technically correct and/or more elegant solution with what the client wants (which often differs) and can do this quickly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You're not afraid to ship code! We don't care if it's not done yet. Push it up and get feedback!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our company does not offer equity as we’re not a venture backed startup. However, there’s the possibility in the future for a revenue share of profit split at year’s end based on tenure.</p>\n<p>To apply for this role, send <a href=\"mailto:ben@lightmatter.com\">ben@lightmatter.com</a> an introductory email and attach your resume and cover letter along with your github profile if applicable.</p>\n",
